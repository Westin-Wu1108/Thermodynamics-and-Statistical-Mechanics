# Thermodynamics-and-Statistical-Mechanics
Here, I develop a set of notes that explore the mathematical structure underlying thermal and statistical physics, using Kittel’s Thermal Physics (2nd edition) as the primary reference. Rather than focusing on formula memorization or standard problem-solving techniques, the discussion emphasizes the logical foundations of statistical ensembles, entropy, and thermodynamic potentials, highlighting how macroscopic laws emerge from microscopic descriptions. The aim is to make the theoretical framework transparent and internally consistent, serving as a bridge between introductory thermal physics and a more rigorous, theory-oriented understanding of statistical mechanics.
